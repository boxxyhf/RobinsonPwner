## RobinsonPwner

Hello and welcome to the gitpage of the RonbinsonPwner.
This script is an upvote bot for the populair dutch T.V. serie 'Expeditierobinson'. In short: This show wants to send people to an island to execute a couple of quests. Those people who want to participate can upload a video to the website and ask other people to vote for them, the top 50 gets a chance to play in the show. This system was broken, no captcha or IP restriction. The only thing that was required to vote was an unique e-mail address. We reported this many times, and got no reaction whatsoever. 

## Idea & Realization

At first this started out as a joke, @bxy tested the website, found a way to auto-vote, and got the idea to create a script to auto-vote, which @bermdingetje created and optimized.

But now that the voting closes we thought it was time to release the code, so everyone can learn and benefit from it
